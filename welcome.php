Genuine curiosity and respectful questions are always welcome, but rude, passive agressive or judgemental comments about peoples' dietary or life choices are not acceptable.

Anyone exhibiting this behaviour will be asked to leave. If you feel you will not be able to abide by these principles, you don't need to come; kindly find something else to do with your day.
