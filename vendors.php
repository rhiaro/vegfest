Who is this for?
</h2>
<p>
We're aiming to include a selection of <strong>local small businesses</strong> who offer <strong>excellent choices for people following a vegan diet</strong> or lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
We include businesses and organisations who may not be specifically targeting vegans, but who operate with a compatible ethos - for example, with <strong>compassion for others, holistic wellbeing, or sustainability at their heart</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The main criteria you need to meet is that you provide <strong>a thoughtful range of vegan options as part of your regular menu, line, or offerings</strong>. We prioritise businesses based in Fife, followed by Perth & Kinrosshire, Stirlingshire, and Tayside, but we would also love to feature businesses from other parts of Scotland who provide a particularly unique or interesting vegan product.
</p>
<p>
If this is you - or if this is something you'd like to move towards - <strong>we'd love to hear from you</strong>.
</p>

What will it cost?
</h2>
<p>
The event is not run for profit, and we ask that stallholders contribute to covering the costs of running the event. This figure will depend on the location and number of vendors who confirm; we'll publish the expected fee here nearer the time. (For reference: vendors contributed Â£20 for the first two VegFests.)
</p>
<p>
There will be no charge for the public entering the venue; they can spend every penny on your delicious treats.
</p>

What's in it for me?
</h2>
<p>
We'd love for you to show off your vegan food offerings to <strong>raise your profile</strong> among Fifers with dietary restrictions and those making eco-conscious food choices. It can be hard for us to find good options - let us know that you can cater for us! And spend the day selling your fare to <strong>a new audience</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Our <a href="vegfest1">first</a> and <a href="vegfest2">second</a> VegFests had hundreds of people through the doors, and many vendors sold out.
</p>
<p>
This will also be an opportunity to <strong>network with and get inspiration</strong> from other small businesses facing similar challenges and opportunities, as well as representatives from local authorities and sustainability or food activism networks. And a chance to <strong>meet local foodies</strong> with ideas and enthusiasm for your vegan options.
</p>
<h2 class="orange">
What should we bring?
</h2>
<p>
If you're a food business, come along with <strong>vegan-friendly food and drinks</strong> that you regularly serve as part of your menu, or that you're thinking about dishing up in the near future and want to get some feedback on. (Please bring <em>only</em> vegan/plant-based products. We're happy to advise if you're not sure about something.)
</p>
<p>
Depending on what you offer, your goods may be prepackaged to take away, or you may want to "plate up" on demand. Food should be served in <strong>takeaway containers</strong> - please bring your own (along with napkins, cutlery, etc as appropriate).
</p>
<p>
For other businesses, please bring <strong>products to sell</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Please bring what you need to take payments (cash, card or both) and make your pricing clear. If possible, we'd encourage you to offer a few <strong>free samples</strong>, to entice those who aren't sure about vegan food or the cuisine or products you offer.
</p>
<p>
Please <strong>bring signage</strong> so people know who you are and where to find you. Do bring flyers, business cards, your vegan menu (or your full menu with vegan options highlighted) or similar to promote yourselves.

We'll update this nearer the time, when the venue is confirmed.
</p>
<h2 class="orange">
Who is organising this?
</h2>
<p>
Amy, Tony, Lea and Shiva are Kirkcaldy-based community-minded vegan foodies, who want to celebrate what our town and the wider area have, and to whet the local appetite for more. We want to support local businesses, and bring something positive to Kirkcaldy.
</p>
<h2 class="orange">
What else is happening?
</h2>
<p>
VegFest is mainly food-oriented, but we'll also have panel discussions, crafts, and other workshops. We'll be updating our website timetable information as we get it.
