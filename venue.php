Location
</h2>
<p>
The next Fife VegFest will be on the pedestrianised area of <strong>Kirkcaldy High St</strong>, between the Mercat shopping centre and Kirk Wynd.
</p>
<p>
Kirkcaldy is easily reached by train and bus links, and the High St is a short walk from both stations. There are benches all along the High St where you can sit and enjoy your food, as well as the nearby promenade where you can sit with a view of the sea.
</p>
<p>
The Creative Space will be indoors, with a variety of seating as well.
</p>
<p>
We will publish a map and video of the accessible walking route from the train and bus stations nearer the time.
